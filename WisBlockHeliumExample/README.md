# Send data to Ubidots, using WisBlock and Helium

## Introduction

This repository includes a simple tutorial to send environmental data to Ubidots.
For that, we use the Helium network, to send data. In this example I don't use a hotspot of my own, instead of that I'm just using the coverage that already exists in my home.
