# Heat Index Monitor

## Introduction

This repository includes a project replicated from the Blues Wireless' accelerator: Heat Index. The idea is to modify this project in order to make it work with WisBlock from RAKwireless and connecting data to the cloud using LoRaWAN and celullar networks.

With this solution it's possible to measure the heat index having into account the temperature and humidity and send this data to the cloud, using LoRaWAN or cellular networks.

## Necessary Hardware 
For this project the following RAKwireless products will be necessary:

- [WisBlock Baseboard RAK19007](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak19007-wisblock-base-board-2nd-gen)
- [WisBlock Core RAK4631](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4631-lpwan-node?variant=37505443987654)
- [Environment Sensor BOSCH BME680 - RAK1906](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1906-bme680-environment-sensor)
- WisBlock Blues Carrier Module (To be updated)
- [Temperature and Humidity Sensor Sensirion SHTC3 - RAK1901](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak1901-shtc3-temperature-humidity-sensor) (Alternative)


And the necessary Blues elements will be:

- [Blues Notecard](https://blues.io/products/notecard/) (Select one according your location)
- [Blues Notecarrier A, B or F](https://blues.io/products/notecarrier/) (Optional)


## Hardware Connection
Connecting the WisBlock elements is easy: just plug the core into the core slot, the environmental sensor on any sensor slot, and finally, connect the antennas of the Notecard and the LoRa antenna on the RAK4631 

This time we will use the RAK19007 motherboard, but, [here](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base) you can select another board. If you have any doubt about the Hardware configuration, you can visit the WisBlock official documentation [here](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/Quickstart/#hardware-setup). The final result that you will get is shown in the next figure:

After that you can put this project in an enclossure and you will get a final product ready to install, like the shown in the next Figure:

## Firmware development 

## Some details

When working with LoRaWAN, you need to choose a LNS (either TTN, Chirpstack, etc), it will provide you credentials whether you are using OTAA or ABP connection mode, modify your code with your credentials to successfully connect to the network.

```
//OTAA keys !!!! KEYS ARE MSB !!!!
uint8_t nodeDeviceEUI[8] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppEUI[8] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
uint8_t nodeAppKey[16] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
// ABP keys
uint32_t nodeDevAddr = 0x260116F8;
uint8_t nodeNwsKey[16] = {0x7E, 0xAC, 0xE2, 0x55, 0xB8, 0xA5, 0xE2, 0x69, 0x91, 0x51, 0x96, 0x06, 0x47, 0x56, 0x9D, 0x23};
uint8_t nodeAppsKey[16] = {0xFB, 0xAC, 0xB6, 0x47, 0xF3, 0x58, 0x45, 0xC7, 0x50, 0x7D, 0xBF, 0x16, 0x8B, 0xA8, 0xC1, 0x7C};
```

The LoRaWAN code works with events, that means you don't need to add anything in the loop function for the code to work correctly, just modify the sending time and buffer size parameters that you need to transmit in the `lorawan_code.h`.

```
/ Private definition
#define LORAWAN_APP_DATA_BUFF_SIZE 64 /**< buffer size of the data to be transmitted. */
#define LORAWAN_APP_INTERVAL 60000 /**< Defines for user timer, the application data transmission interval. 20s, value in [ms]. */
```
Finally, if you are sending data using the Notecard, you need to first send the data to the Notehub, the blues platform to work as a connection between our end device and the IoT platform. For that, you need to edit the `blues_conf.h` file and define your `PRODUCT_UID` according to your credential in your Notehub account.

```
#define PRODUCT_UID "com.company.username:projectname"
```

### LoRaWAN communication

The process to communicate end devices via LoRaWAN networks can be done via a public network like [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) or set up your own network using a gateway for LoRaWAN. In this case, we will configure the second option. For this process you will need:

- [A gateways for LoRaWAN](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisgate-edge)
- [TTN account](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/)

The gateway needs to be configured to work in base station mode, then it will be added to TTN creating a security token, finally creating the end devices with the credentials to be replaced in code as explained. before. This process is simple and can be done in a few minutes, check our [official documentation](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268-V2/Supported-LoRa-Network-Servers/#wisgateos-2-basics-station-to-ttnv3) for the step by step process.

### Blues Communication

This process is even simpler than setting up the LoRaWAN network, just create an account on the [Notehub page](https://notehub.io/sign-in?flow=473ef4b7-c19d-4440-a5d4-c2d1bb9d25b6) and create a new project. This project will be created with a unique identifier that needs to be added to the code, as mentioned above. You will need to add a device and add your Notecard that you are working with. You can review the Blues documentation to see the [process step by step](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268-V2/Supported-LoRa-Network-Servers/#wisgateos-2-basics-station-to-ttnv3).

### Ubidots Connection

Finally, the connection to Ubidots will be made by integrating the two platforms, TTN and Notehub, with Ubidots. In this part, you need to keep in mind that you are sending data with different payloads, so Ubidtos needs to be able to recognize this format and translate it to display the data in dashboards.

You can create two devices in Ubidots or try to configure one device to receive data from different platforms. In either case, you must translate the payload so that the IoT platform can read it. To use this you will need to have a decoder function, the decoder functions examples are the `.js` files in the repo, just copy and paste on the DataCake platform.

Considering the above decoders, the process to connect Notehub and TTN with Ubidots is not complicated. You can consult the complete [Blues](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/4990386-learn-how-to-connect-blues-wireless-notecard-powered-app-to-ubidots) and [TTN](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/5096476-plugins-connect-the-things-stack-to-ubidots) tutorial on Ubidots official website.
